## Efficiency  
- Well structured, Gives the ability to add a new algorithm in just few minutes.
- Full control of the main thread using All-Async modules.
---

### Topics used for implementation.  
- P5.js
- Particles.js
- Basic-Factory Method Design Pattern.  
---  
## Additional Information  
- This is the first version of the project, Which gives the core and fundamental sorting algorithms a visualiztion.
- More Algorithms to be added soon before deploying.
- More features will be added in the next version.
